# Microsoft SqlClient Data Provider for SQL Server

Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is a .NET data provider for [Microsoft SQL Server]([url](https://aka.ms/sql)) and the [Azure SQL]([url](https://aka.ms/azure_sql)) family of databases. It grew from a union of the two System.Data.SqlClient components which live independently in .NET Framework and .NET Core. Going forward, support for new SQL Server and Azure SQL features will only be implemented in Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.

## Supportability

The Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package supports the following environments:

- .NET Framework 4.6.2+
- .NET 8.0+

## Download

The Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet package is available on [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient/).

## SNI Package References

When targeting .NET Framework on Windows, a package reference to [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI/) loads native `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.<platform>.dll` libraries into the client's build directories.

When targeting .NET on Windows, a package reference to [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.runtime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.runtime/) loads `arm64`, `x64` and `x86` native `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.dll` libraries into subdirectories in the client's build directory.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
