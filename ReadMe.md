Hi,

My name is Denis Zinukov and there is my portfolio.

In the portfolio I tried to use all best practices provided by vendor and tried automating all everyday tasks such as ETL and maintenance.
I have realized next features:

1.	Three step loading data.
2.	Cleaning data with DQS.
3.	Master data management system with MDS.
4.	Slow changing dimensions
5.	Loading Audit
6.	Partitioning and filegroups management
7.	Incremental load of fact data using switch partition.
8.	Reloading and reorganizing indexes
9.	Updating statistics
10.	Partial Backup strategy
11.	Health monitoring reports on Power BI Report Server
12.	CI/CD pipelines
